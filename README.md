===========

Playing around with some of the new Lollipop APIs/support lib, in particular the recycler view and animations.

Animations 'Hierachical timing' and 'Consistent choreography' are based on the examples in the material design guidelines: http://www.google.co.uk/design/spec/animation/meaningful-transitions.html#meaningful-transitions-hierarchical-timing
